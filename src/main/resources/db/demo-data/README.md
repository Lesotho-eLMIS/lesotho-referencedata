# Performance Data

The files in this directory define larger sets of reference data to be used in 
performance testing.  See the project README for how to load this data.

The directory `demo-datasets/` holds IDs that are expected to exist from demo-data.
Therefore changing ID's in demo-data may need for these files to be re-generated.

The directory `schemas/` holds copies of the Mockaroo schemas used for generating
data. When the set of schemas on Mockaroo changes, please revision them here.

**WARNING**: the contents of this directory are managed through an external
generation tool.  Please do not edit these files by hand.
