-- This SQL query is necessary in order to conceptually separate out the recursion involved in 
-- getting all supervised facilities, direct and indirect, under a supervisory node.
--
-- The recursive CTE supervisory_nodes_recursive returns a list of all supervisory node IDs that 
-- are descendants of the supervisory node ID specified. That list is then fed to the query below
-- to expand each supervisory node ID into a list of facility IDs (based on the specified program
-- ID), then merged into a distinct list.
--
-- Input: supervisory node ID and program ID
-- Output: a list of all supervised facility IDs
